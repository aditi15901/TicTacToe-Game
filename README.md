# TicTacToe-Game
To design the basics of a two-player game of Tic-Tac-Toe using OOP in Java.
        Tic Tac Toe is a puzzle game for two players, called X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid.
        The player who succeeded in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
        You can either play 2-Player Version or Computer v/s Player Version! 
        
The Computer v/s Player Version has two modes, one Easy and one Hard. 
    (i) In the Easy mode, either of the player or computer can win or the game might end in a tie. 
        Here, computer uses random inputs unless it has a winning move.
    (ii) In the Hard mode, the game can only end in a tie or with the computer winning. Hence, the Player will
        never win.
